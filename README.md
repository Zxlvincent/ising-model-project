# Ising Model Monte Carlo Simulation (Mini Project)

## Content structure:

- `ising_sim.cpp`: One-dimensional and two-dimensional Ising simulators implemented in C++ (using object-oriented programming OOP style)

- `ising_1d.csv` / `ising_2d.csv`: Energy and magnetization data generated by simulation

- `ising_plot.ipynb`: Energy distribution diagram, magnetization distribution diagram, average trend diagram and convergence diagram are drawn in Python

- `Xuanlin Zhu- report.pdf`: Project analysis report (including model description and experimental results analysis)

## Instructions for use:

1. Run `ising_sim.cpp` to generate CSV data

2. Use Jupyter Notebook to open `ising_plot.ipynb` and run all cells to generate images

3. All images have been automatically saved as PNG and can be used for report writing

## Git version tracking

This project uses Git Version tracking is performed to record all key modification histories, reflecting a good development process.
